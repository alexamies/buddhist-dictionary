        <strong>2020-05-31</strong>:<br/>
        Created new file buddhist_named_entities.txt for Buddhist
        named entities (people, organizations, temples, etc) because
        thre could potentially be many thousands of these that are 
        not included in dictionaries. Keeping them in a separate list
        allows for them to be managed sepraately. For the moment it has
        few entries and mainly serves as a placeholder.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2020-05-29</strong>:<br/>
        A large update to vocabulary, now with a total of over 140,000 entries.
        Most of the new vocabulary is from CC-CEDICT with some cross checking
        in various sources.
        Modern named entities (people, products, organizations, etc) are 
        steadily being excluded so that they are not confused in Buddhist
        texts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2020-04-10</strong>:<br/>
        A large update to vocabulary, now with a total of over 110,000 entries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2020-02-15</strong>:<br/>
        A new text tokenizer has been introduced that scans both left to right
        and right to left then compares the two. The scan with the least number
        of terms will be selected. There is rarely a difference but sometimes
        the difference can be important. For example, for the phrase from the
        <i>Blue Cliff Record</i> Koan 10:<br/>
        只恐龍頭蛇尾<br/>
        I’m afraid he has a dragon’s head but a snake’s tail
        (tr. Cleary 1998, p. 63).<br/>
        Left to right tokenization would lead to<br/>
        只、恐龍、頭、蛇、尾<br/>
        Right to left tokenization results in<br/>
        只、恐、龍頭蛇尾<br/>
        Clearly, the right to left tokenization is better in this case and is
        selected because there are fewer tokens: 3 for right to left compared
        to 5 for left to right. The left to right scanning method misses the
        idiom 龍頭蛇尾 dragon’s head but a snake’s tail, which is skipped over
        because of the greedy tokenization method used is not always globally
        optimal.
      </p>
      <p>
        A second change that has been introduced was to separate modern named
        entities into a separate file that is excluded from the NTI Reader.
        These modern named entities are occasionally conflated with terms in
        the Buddhist canon by random inclusion. For example, company names and
        names of modern countries, especially two character names. These seem
        obvious and silly to a human reader. The modern named entities are still
        included in the
        <a href="https://hbreader.org">Humanistic Buddhism Reader</a> for
        Venerable Master Hsing Yun's ollected works and and
        <a href="https://chinesenotes.com">Chinese Notes</a> for other Chinese
        literature. It will take some time to fully separate out these named
        entities from the general dictionary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other ways of improving the accuracy of the tokenizer are being
        evaluated. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The vocabulary has been updated with new words, corrections, and
        references. Please let me know if you see any problems
        by emailing alex@ntireader.org.

      <p>
        <strong>2020-01-10</strong>:<br/>
        Summary of major recent updates:
        <b>Vocabulary</b><br/>
        Checking and expanding of the vocabulary with continued focus on
        literary Chinese. Current stats are: 93,821 headwords with 14,920
        Buddhist terms<br/><br/>

        <b>Usability</b><br/>
        Better offline access has been added by writing a version of the
        dictionary that runs in JavaScript on the browser. So, even if you are
        totally disconnected from the Internet the dictionary and reader can
        still be used. This requires the dictionary to be downloaded to the
        browser in JavaScript form in the first place. If you are on a low
        bandwidth connection and never had an opportunity to do that then it
        still may not work offline.<br/><br/>

        When segmenting text the identified text segments, multi-character
        terms are also broken down into their parts. In the reader vocabulary
        dialog box, just click on any word. In dictionary lookup mode click on
        the 'split' link. If the text segmentation is not what you expect then
        check the individual parts. This requires the dictionary to be
        downloaded to the browser in JavaScript form, as for offline access.
        There may be some performance issues on long pages. Please email
        alex@ntireader.org if you notice problems.
        <br/><br/>

        English translations for multi-word expressions are shown under a
        'Contained In' header in the headword pages. This makes it easier to
        scan example uses for different word senses.<br/><br/>
