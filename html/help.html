      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        There are number of features of the NTI Reader dictionary intended to
        improve usability. You can find definitions of modern and literary
        Chinese (文言文) and Buddhist words. You do not have to look words up
        one at a time in the NTI Reader dictionary. You can simply paste an
        entire block of text into the input field. Even though Chinese text
        does not have spaces separating the words, you should be able to use the
        dictionary without knowing where words start or end in a text. 
        In addition, the dictionary will help you find the best word sense.

      <h3>Basic Use</h3>
      <p>
        For basic use of the dictionary type in or cut and paste in the Chinese
        or English for the word that you are looking for and click the Search
        button. You can enter either simplified or traditional Chinese to search
        on. If you don't get what you are looking for or don't understand the
        results then keep reading or look at the list of Help topics above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each word entry includes a list of word senses. Different word senses
        may also include different pronunciations and parts of speech (grammar).
        If you don't see the word sense that you are looking for in the summary
        page, follow the link to the detailed page for all word senses.
      </p>
      <a name='matches'></a>
      <h3>No matches found</h3>
      <p>
        If you do not get any matches for your search try searching the whole
        block of text that you are studying. This mode will always find a result
        if the input is one or more Chinese characters because
        it will break the string of characters down into individual characters.
        At least the individual characters will have entries. See the
        description in the section <a href='#text'>Breaking Chinese text into
        words</a> for more details on this mode.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the individual characters do not have entries or if you have a word
        that you feel should be in the dictionary please let me know by sending
        an email to alex@chinesenotes.com.
      </p>
      <a name='text'></a>
      <h3 class='article'>Breaking Chinese text into words</h3>
      <p>
        The dictionary can help you look up individual words or all the words in
        a block of text. Because Chinese words do not have spaces between them
        in sentences it can help to look up all the words in the text.
        Especially if you are a beginner or trying to make the jump from study
        to using Chinese in real life it can often be hard to figure out the
        boundaries between the words.  This is where pasting a whole block of
        text into the dictionary search input field can help.

      <h3>Disambiguating different senses of a Chinese word</h3>
      <p>
         Chinese is a rich language with a long history and this leads to words
         that have many different meanings. That is, the same character or
         combination of characters has different meanings in different contexts.
         There are two different cases of this: (a) a <i>homonym</i>, where the
         words are truly different, and (b) <i>polysemy</i>, where there a
         multiple related senses of the word. Chinese is a different from
         languages like English where more-or-less phonetic spellings are used
         because the same character may have multiple different pronunciations.  
         In fact, 'spelling' does not really apply to Chinese. Determining the
         correct meaning for a word in a particular sentence or other context
         is called word-sense disambiguation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The English equivalents in the dictionary are often separated by
        <em>/</em> characters. It is useful to give more than one English word
        describing a single Chinese word because the English words themselves
        can have multiple meanings. In addition, words usually have a range of
        meanings and can be used in a range of contexts. So, giving several
        English words can give a sense of the range of uses of a Chinese word.
        In addition to the range of meanings possible, a translator will need
        to choose the most appropriate word to use in a translation. It is
        useful to have several equivalents in the dictionary to choose from.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at an example, the character 是 (pinyin: shì), which is one
        of the most common words in Chinese that most often means 'is.' There
        are at least eight different meanings found for this character.
        The most common word sense in modern Chinese is verb <em>is</em>.
        However, the most common sense in literary Chinese is the pronoun
        <em>this</em>. Think of the word returned in the summary table as the
        word sense with the most likely best fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        To disambiguate between modern and literary Chinese click the use <em>Options</em> link on the
        dictionary page and select the <em>type</em> radio button.
        Because there are so many different word senses of words in literary Chinese it can be hard to pick
        the most appropriate one. 
        The other word senses can be seen by cliking on the <em>word senses</em> link.
      </p>
      <p>
        When reading an article or a book you are aware of the sense of words based on the words around them.
        The NTI Reader dictionary helps you in the same way although it is only a statistical selection because
        computers cannot really think like people. If you paste a block of text into the input field
        in literary Chinese mode (the default) then it will select words based on both preceding words
        and the overall most frequently used words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider another example: the word 他 (tā), which usually means <em>he</em>, the singular second person 
        masculine pronoun in modern Chinese. That is what you find in the dictionary if you do a lookup
        in modern Chinese mode. However, if you lookup the word in literary Chinese mode, you will find
        that the first definition listed is the pronoun <em>other / another</em>. However, if you 
        paste a block of text in you may get a better suggestion as the first entry. Try pasting the 
        text block 哆他伽哆夜 from the dhāranī ending the Amitabha Sutra. You will find that the 
        word sense listed first for 他 is <em>ta</em>, with the note <em>used for the sound in mantras</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dictionary does all this by basing the suggested word in the table of returned results 
        based on statistical selection compiled from a treebank. A treebank, also known as a tagged corpus, is a body of 
        text tagged for part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc). The 
        <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/tree/master/web/corpus/tagged">NTI Reader dictionary treebank</a> 
        is based on literary Chinese Buddhist texts. It is tagged for both part of speech and word sense. 
        There are two frequency tables: a unigram table for the overall frequency of words and a bigram
        table that records how common a word is given the word that came before it.
