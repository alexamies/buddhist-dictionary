<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>
  The goals the project are
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Create an online dictionary that is easy to use for everybody interested in Buddhism, 
    including lay people reading Buddhist texts, students, translators, and academics.
    If you are looking at a large chunk of Chinese Buddhist text but not sure what it means
    then this is for you. See notes on the <a href="translation_workflow.html#casual">Casual 
    use for a private translation</a> workflow on ways that you can use the web site for 
    this purpose.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create electronic tools that are useful for lingustic analysis of Buddhist texts, 
    including identification of specialist Buddhist terms and comparison of 
    Chinese and Sanskrit texts.
    If your goal is to translate the Mahāyāna Tripiṭaka, then this website and 
    GitHub project is especially for you.  See the workflow described in the section 
    <a href="translation_workflow.html#contributor">Project team member for a publicly 
    available translation</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Share the source code and content with the general public. If you want to reuse source
    code or contribute source code or data then the 
    <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary">GitHub project</a> is built for you.
