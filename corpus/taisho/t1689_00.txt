<h4>Summary</h4>
This text describes the proper procedure for inviting the Arhat Pindola Bharadvaja to offerings and ceremonies. It emphasizes the importance of sincere faith and respect when inviting him for meals, bathing rituals, and blessings of new houses. One story illustrates the consequences of disrespect, where a wealthy man's flowers withered due to his servant barring Pindola from entering. To ensure his presence, the host must prepare a clean and fragrant space, invite him with reverence, and avoid checking on him, trusting that his sincerity will be rewarded with signs of his presence.
