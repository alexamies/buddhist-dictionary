<h4>Summary</h4>
Shortly after the Buddha's passing, Venerable Ananda is visited by a former associate who questions him about the Buddha's teachings on rejecting wrong views. The man specifically asks if the Buddha dismissed views about the permanence and limits of the world, the relationship between body and soul, and the afterlife. Ananda confirms that the Buddha, possessing wisdom and insight, did indeed reject these wrong views because they lead to specific consequences and a particular kind of rebirth. Impressed, the man declares his refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, becoming a lay follower.
