<h4>Summary</h4>
While in the city, a disciple of the Buddha named Maha-Kasyapa encountered an impoverished and suffering old woman living in a dung heap. Seeing her plight, he asked for a small offering, and she gave him some foul-smelling rice water. Maha-Kasyapa then displayed miraculous powers, which led to her death and subsequent rebirth in the heavens as a powerful goddess. Sakra, king of the gods, was astonished and learned about the woman's previous offering, which led him to seek out Maha-Kasyapa to make an offering himself.
