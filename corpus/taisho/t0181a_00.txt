<h4>Summary</h4>
A long time ago, a Bodhisattva was reborn as a nine-colored deer with beautiful multicolored fur and white antlers. One day, the deer rescued a
drowning man and told him not to reveal its location, as humans coveted its hide and antlers. However, when the queen of the kingdom dreamed of
the deer and desired its fur and antlers, the man betrayed the deer’s trust, revealing its whereabouts to the king in exchange for riches.
When the king led his army to capture the deer, the deer reminded him of its past kindness, shaming the king, who then protected the deer and its kind.
