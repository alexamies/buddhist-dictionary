<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha, residing in the Jeta Grove, was approached by fifty worried young men seeking help because their homes were plagued by misfortune and evil spirits. The Buddha agreed to help and, after a meal at their home, summoned the protective deities and warned them against disturbing the residents. He then taught a series of mantras and spells to protect the home from evil influences, ensuring peace, prosperity, and the well-being of the household. Finally, the Buddha instructed that 49 lamps should be lit in the courtyard while one repents and bows to the Buddhas of the ten directions.
