<h4>Summary</h4>
The Sujātā Sutra tells the story of a woman named Sujātā, wife of the son of Anāthapiṇḍika, who was arrogant and disrespectful towards her elders. Buddha uses his powers and teachings to humble Sujātā, revealing the ten evils of women and describing the duties and virtues of a good wife, as well as the different types of wives that exist. Sujātā is repentant and vows to become a virtuous wife, following the Buddha's teachings and taking vows as a lay follower (Upasika). The Buddha then blesses her and instructs her to follow the precepts, ensuring her a better future life.
