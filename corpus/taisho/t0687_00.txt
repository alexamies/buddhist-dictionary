<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha asked the monks how one could repay the deep love and sacrifices of parents, who endure great pain in childbirth and devote their lives to
raising their children. The monks responded that honoring and caring for one's parents with kindness was the best way to repay them. However,
the Buddha explained that true filial piety is not just about material care but guiding one's parents toward righteousness—encouraging them to
follow moral teachings, avoid evil, and uphold the Five Precepts. He emphasized that leading parents to spiritual enlightenment outweighs any
physical support, as it ensures their well-being in both this life and the afterlife.
