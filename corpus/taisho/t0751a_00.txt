<h4>Summary</h4>
A Brahmin traveled from Rajagriha to Sravasti, where he saw a father continuing to plow his field despite his son's death from a snakebite,
and neither he nor his family mourned the loss. The Brahmin, shocked by their lack of sorrow, sought an explanation from the Buddha, who
taught him that wise people understand the impermanence of life and that grieving does not benefit the dead. Enlightened by the Buddha’s
words, the Brahmin realized the futility of sorrow, likening his experience to a sick person being cured or a blind person gaining sight,
and he accepted the Buddha's teachings.
