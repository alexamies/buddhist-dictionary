<h4>Summary</h4>
In this Buddhist scripture, the Buddha is in the Yellow Bamboo Grove when an elderly Brahmin approaches him and criticizes him for not showing proper respect. The Buddha responds by stating that he does not show respect because he has overcome the causes of such behavior. He describes his path to enlightenment, including the attainment of the four levels of meditation and the three insights (knowledge of past lives, the ability to see the destiny of beings, and the extinction of outflows) which led him to liberation from suffering. Impressed by the Buddha's profound understanding, the Brahmin expresses his faith, takes refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, and vows to abstain from killing.
