<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha tells a story of an ass who tries to imitate well-behaved cattle by eating soft grass and drinking clean water, but is rejected by them because it cannot truly be like them. Similarly, a corrupt monk may try to imitate virtuous monks in their practices and demeanor to gain material benefits, but is ultimately exposed and expelled from their community. The Buddha advises monks to abandon non-virtuous practices and diligently cultivate virtuous ones. This story emphasizes the importance of genuine practice and the rejection of hypocrisy within the monastic community.
