<h4>Summary</h4>
At one time, the Buddha was staying in Jetavana Monastery when a celestial prince named Pilu descended and asked if anyone in the world sought virtuous deeds
rather than material wealth. The Buddha praised the question and explained that people can indeed seek the treasures of virtue, and that good or evil deeds
inevitably bring corresponding consequences, like a shadow following the body. The prince then recounted a past life in which he was a king who wished to
help his people by creating a great drum to spread news of generosity.
