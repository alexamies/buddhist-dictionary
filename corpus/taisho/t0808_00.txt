<h4>Summary</h4>
When the Buddha was ill and needed milk, Ananda was sent to a Brahmin household to ask for some. A fierce cow was offered, but Ananda hesitated to milk it himself. Through divine intervention and a transformed Brahmin, the milk was obtained, and the calf expressed its joy at offering its share of milk to the Buddha, seeing it as a means to enlightenment after many lifetimes of suffering due to disbelief. The Buddha then prophesied that both the cow and calf would achieve enlightenment in future lives as a result of their meritorious act.
