<h4>Summary</h4>
This text recounts the story of a Bodhisattva who, as a former king, renounced his throne to seek enlightenment, adopting a Brahmin's way of life and name. He was later wrongly accused of robbery and sentenced to death, prompting the Brahmin to miraculously create two children from the Bodhisattva's blood. The narrative then shifts to describing the lineage of kings and the gradual decline of human lifespan, culminating in the future Buddha's decision to be reborn into the family of King Suddhodana, foreshadowing his birth and early life.
