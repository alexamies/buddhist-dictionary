<h4>Summary</h4>
This text tells the story of King Udayana who, after being offered a beautiful woman by her father, is taught by the Buddha about the impure and undesirable nature of the body, particularly that of women. The king then takes the woman as his queen, but is misled by her to persecute his virtuous first queen, who is a follower of the Buddha. Eventually, the king realizes his error after witnessing her miraculous display of compassion and seeks forgiveness from the Buddha, vowing to restrain his desires and follow the Buddha's teachings.
