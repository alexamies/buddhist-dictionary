<h4>Summary</h4>
This text tells the story of King Ajatasatru seeking a prophecy from the Buddha. Initially, his grand offerings didn't earn him one, but a poor woman's sincere offering of a single lamp and a humble gardener's scattering of flowers did. The King, learning the importance of sincere intention, prepared a jeweled offering with his family, only to learn the Buddha had passed. Despite this, he offered it where Buddha had sat, and due to his sincerity, finally received a prophecy of becoming a Buddha in a future eon.
