<h4>Summary</h4>
This text recounts a conversation between King Ajatasattu and the Buddha regarding the consequences of the five rebellious acts, particularly the king's own patricide. Devadatta attempts to reassure the king that he won't suffer for his actions, but the Buddha clarifies that Ajatasattu will initially fall into hell but will eventually progress through realms and ultimately become a Pratyekabuddha. The Buddha emphasizes the importance of intent and its impact on one's karmic journey. Finally, Jivaka, a prince, confirms the Buddha's words, but the king remains skeptical about visiting the Buddha until he is sure that the Buddha is truly all-knowing.
