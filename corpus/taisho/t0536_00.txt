<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha, residing in a kingdom where his teachings are revered, is invited to a meal by a wealthy man named Shen Ri, who is influenced by other religious practitioners to test the Buddha's omniscience by poisoning the food and setting a trap. Shen Ri's son, a believer in the Buddha, warns against this, but is ignored. However, the Buddha, aware of the plot, transforms the trap into a lotus pond and removes the poison from the food, demonstrating his power and compassion. Shen Ri, witnessing this miracle, repents, converts to Buddhism, and takes the five precepts.
