<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha, in the presence of a large assembly, emits radiant light and smiles, prompting Ananda to inquire about the reasons behind this extraordinary display. The Buddha recounts a past life where he was a woman who sacrificed her breasts to feed a starving mother, later transformed into a man-king who ruled with righteousness and generosity, and finally, as a Brahmin who offered his body to a starving tiger. This story illustrates the Buddha's past lives of intense devotion and self-sacrifice, emphasizing the immense merit gained through acts of generosity and compassion.
