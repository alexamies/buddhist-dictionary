<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha, residing in Rajagriha, answers a question from a layperson named Nandi and his followers regarding the five precepts for lay Buddhists and the consequences of violating them. He explains that transgressions such as harming living beings, stealing, engaging in sexual misconduct, lying, and consuming alcohol each result in ten or more negative consequences in this life and the next, including suffering, distrust, and rebirth in unfavorable realms. Nandi and his followers, along with deities and others, are delighted by the teaching and vow to uphold the precepts throughout their lives. The sermon emphasizes the importance of adhering to ethical conduct for positive outcomes and avoiding negative karma.
