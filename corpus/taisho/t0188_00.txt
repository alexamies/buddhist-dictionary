<h4>Summary</h4>
This text narrates the story of how Śākyamuni Buddha became enlightened in a previous life. As a bodhisattva named Maṇava, he purchased lotus flowers to offer to the Buddha Dīpankara, receiving a prophecy that he would become the Buddha Śākyamuni after ninety kalpas. The text describes his subsequent rebirths and eventual birth as Prince Siddhartha, detailing the events leading to his renunciation of worldly life and his eventual enlightenment under a tree after enduring hardships and meditation. Finally, it tells about the dragon king who became his first devotee and his returning to teach his 5 former companions, leading to many conversions and miracles.
