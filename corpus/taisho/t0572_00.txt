<h4>Summary</h4>
At one time, the Buddha was staying in the Jeta Grove with 1,250 monks and 10,000 bodhisattvas. One morning, as the Buddha and his followers entered the
city to collect alms, celestial beings praised the Buddha with music and verses, highlighting his vast compassion, wisdom, and radiant appearance.
A noblewoman, upon seeing the Buddha’s divine light and realizing her own harsh behavior, repented deeply and was inspired by the Buddha's teachings
on impermanence, morality, and the path to enlightenment.
