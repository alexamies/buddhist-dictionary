<h4>Summary</h4>
Once, the Buddha was in Śrāvastī at the Jetavana monastery, where he was frequently visited and honored by King Fanmonan, who, along with his court,
listened to the Buddha’s teachings with great devotion. The king’s son realized the impermanence of life and renounced his royal status to become a
monk, diligently practicing until he attained Arhatship within three months. When the king, unaware of his son’s enlightenment, questioned his austere
lifestyle, the Buddha instructed Kuṇḍalī to demonstrate his spiritual powers, which moved the king deeply.
