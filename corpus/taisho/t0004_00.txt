<h4>Summary</h4>
While staying in the country of Savatthi, the Buddha overheard his monks discussing his knowledge of past and future Buddhas.

He also shared the number of monks who attained enlightenment during each Buddha's first sermon. He concluded by emphasizing the importance of studying the teachings and practicing the path.
