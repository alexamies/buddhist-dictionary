<h4>Summary</h4>
A poor man who wished to become a dragon and harm a country due to lack of payment for his services was subdued by a monk named Shahe, who trapped him in his alms bowl. The monk then got drunk, leading to questions about his virtue. Buddha clarified that Shahe's actions were for the benefit of others and to teach a lesson and sent another monk to retrieve the dragon, who then converted to Buddhism, and the people of the dragon's former kingdom converted as well.
