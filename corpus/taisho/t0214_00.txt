<h4>Summary</h4>
A newly ordained monk mistreated an elder monk after being prematurely granted lodging rights. The Buddha recounts a past life story of a foolish Brahman who trusted a thief, ignoring warnings from his companions, and was subsequently robbed and injured. The Buddha reveals that the Brahman was the elder monk, the thief was the newly ordained monk, the companions were the other monks, and he himself was a deva who witnessed the Brahman's misfortune. The Buddha warns against trusting those whose intentions are unclear and ignoring wise counsel.
