<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha recounts a story of fish: large fish warned small fish against leaving their area, but they disobeyed and were caught. This parallels a monk who, despite warnings from senior monks to control his desires, succumbed to lust after seeing beautiful women while begging for food. Consequently, he abandoned his monastic vows and returned to lay life, highlighting the dangers of unchecked desires and the importance of renouncing worldly temptations. The Buddha urges the monks to relinquish acquired gains and avoid greed for those yet to be acquired.
