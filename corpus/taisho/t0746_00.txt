<h4>Summary</h4>
The text details the encounters of a venerable monk with numerous hungry ghosts suffering from various torments near a river. Each ghost asks the monk about the cause of their suffering. The monk explains that their current agonizing state is a consequence of their past misdeeds as humans, such as violence, cruelty, dishonesty, and disrespect toward religious practices and others. By the end of the encounters, the ghosts express remorse for their actions and find solace in the monk's teachings.
