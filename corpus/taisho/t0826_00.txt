<h4>Summary</h4>
This text tells the story of a devout follower of Buddhism who dies and is taken to the underworld. There, the king of the underworld interrogates him about his life and the practices of Buddhist monks, before learning that he was not meant to die yet due to his remaining years and eventual return to the Buddhist teachings. The disciple is then returned to life and shares his experience with the Buddha, who elaborates on the importance of upholding the Buddhist precepts and the consequences of both good and evil actions in the cycle of rebirth. The sutra emphasizes the power of the Buddha's teachings to protect and guide followers away from suffering.
