<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha, while at the Bamboo Garden, instructs the monks to guide and support new members, particularly those with good qualities who are receptive to teaching. He contrasts those who are difficult to teach, driven by negative qualities like greed and anger, with those who are open and virtuous. Monks should examine themselves, striving to cultivate positive attributes like gratitude and avoid harmful behaviors. Just as one uses a mirror to see and remove impurities from the face, monks should reflect on their actions to purify themselves and achieve enlightenment.
