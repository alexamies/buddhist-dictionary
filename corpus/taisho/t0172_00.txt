<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha recounts a story from nine kalpas ago about a prince named Candana-mati who, driven by compassion, sold himself into servitude to alleviate poverty in his kingdom. After a series of events, he becomes the ruler of another kingdom but gives it away. Later, upon becoming a hermit, he selflessly sacrificed himself to feed a starving tigress and her cubs. This act of ultimate generosity led to the construction of a stupa enshrining his remains, which became a place of healing and devotion for those suffering from various ailments.
