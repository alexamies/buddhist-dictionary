<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha is in a mountain surrounded by disciples when he emits a great light, causing confusion and wonder among the assembly. A princess named Profit Practice asks the Buddha about the nature of this light and the path to achieving such a state. The Buddha explains the Lotus Flower Samadhi and the means to attain it, emphasizing understanding the illusory nature of existence and practicing detachment from desires. Ultimately, many in the assembly, including the princess (who transforms into a man), and a king and his son, achieve enlightenment and dedicate themselves to spreading the Dharma, leading to widespread transformations and spiritual awakening.
