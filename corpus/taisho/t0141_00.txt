<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha teaches about the immense debt children owe their parents, emphasizing that material gifts cannot repay their kindness. Instead, children should guide their parents away from harmful actions and towards virtue, lest they fall into lower realms after death. The Buddha then visits the home of a wealthy man named Sudatta, whose daughter-in-law, Yuye, is disrespectful. The Buddha instructs Yuye on the proper duties of a wife, outlining three evils and four virtues in serving her husband, leading her to become a respectful and dutiful wife.
