<h4>Summary</h4>
This text recounts the story of King Bimbisara of Magadha visiting and making offerings to the Buddha. Initially, the Buddha was residing in Sravasti, where he was revered and provided for by many. King Bimbisara, after hearing of the Buddha's virtues, traveled to meet him, and after listening to the Buddha's teachings, the king became a devoted follower. He invited the Buddha and his monastic community to his kingdom for three months, where he provided them with all their needs, leading to the conversion of many and further spreading the Buddha's teachings.
