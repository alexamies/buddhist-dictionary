<h4>Summary</h4>
Shortly after the passing of the Buddha, numerous arhats gathered to compile the scriptures, concerned that the world would fall into darkness without the Buddha's teachings. Mahākāśyapa urged his fellow monks to postpone their own nirvana to help assemble and protect the Buddha's teachings for the benefit of future generations. Several events unfold, including the passing of one arhat who, despite not being invited, transmits a final message of compassion and dedication to the Sangha, before immolating himself, and later the initial exclusion and subsequent inclusion of Ananda, the Buddha's close attendant, in the scripture gathering process. Finally, the scriptures were compiled into the sutras, the vinaya, and the dharma, praised by the gods.
