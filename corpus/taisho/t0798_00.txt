<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha, while residing in Jetavana, taught his disciples about four noble practices: filial piety towards parents,
compassion and non-violence, generosity without reluctance, and renouncing worldly honors to follow the path of truth.
He further emphasized two essential virtues: maintaining tranquility and deep contemplation, as well as acquiring
knowledge and discussing profound teachings, alongside two forms of giving—providing food for physical well-being
and spreading the Dharma for spiritual enlightenment, with Dharma-giving being the highest.
