<h4>Summary</h4>
At one time, the Buddha was residing in Vulture Peak of Rajagriha, where celestial beings, dragons, spirits, kings, and commoners all came to pay homage.
Devadatta, filled with jealousy, conspired with Prince Ajātaśatru, convincing him to overthrow his father, King Bimbisāra, and take the throne. Following
their plan, the prince imprisoned his father, who, despite suffering, remained devoted to the Buddha’s teachings, accepting the impermanence of life.
