<h4>Summary</h4>
The story describes a past life of the Buddha as King Chang Shou, who ruled justly and peacefully. A greedy neighboring king, envious of his
prosperous kingdom, invaded. To avoid bloodshed, King Chang Shou abdicated and fled with his son, Prince Chang Shou. The invading king later captured the
former king and had him executed. Years later, the prince infiltrated the enemy’s court, gained his trust, and had the opportunity to take
revenge but remembered his father’s dying wish to avoid hatred and violence. Instead of killing the usurper, he forgave him, leading to reconciliation.
