<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha, while residing in Śrāvastī, taught about the consequences of good and evil actions, explaining the five paths of existence:
heavenly beings, humans, hungry ghosts, animals, and hellish beings. He emphasized that those who do not seek liberation continue to
suffer in the cycle of birth and death. The Buddha then described the benefits of virtuous actions such as non-killing, honesty,
faithfulness, kindness, and generosity, which lead to happiness, respect, and rebirth in better conditions. Conversely, he warned
against the consequences of harmful actions like killing, stealing, adultery, lying, and intoxication, which result in suffering,
social disgrace, and rebirth in lower realms or hell.
