<h4>Summary</h4>
After the Buddha’s Nirvāṇa, his disciple Ananda asked how his body should be enshrined. The Buddha advised Ananda not to worry about him but mentioned that
Brahmins and noble families would conduct his funeral rites, following the traditions of an imperial funeral. He described how his body should be wrapped
in fine cloth, anointed with fragrant oils, cremated, and his relics placed in a golden urn within a stone reliquary, with a stupa built for veneration.
The Buddha explained that his relics and alms bowl would remain in the world to offer protection and guidance, ensuring peace and spiritual growth among people.
