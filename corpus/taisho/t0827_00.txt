<h4>Summary</h4>
While traveling to a new destination with his disciples and celestial beings, the Buddha noticed a farmer delaying his visit to the Buddha due to his unfinished work. Knowing the farmer's heart, the Buddha emitted light and explained to Ananda that this farmer had repeatedly missed opportunities to be liberated by previous Buddhas because of his laziness and attachment to worldly tasks. Hearing this, the farmer abandoned his work, approached the Buddha with remorse, and received teachings on the importance of diligence, ultimately attaining enlightenment.
