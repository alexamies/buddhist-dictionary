<h4>Summary</h4>
During a gathering, Buddha recounted a past life where he was born as a son named Sham to blind parents, living in the mountains and devotedly caring for them.  A king accidentally shot Sham with a poisoned arrow, causing great sorrow and a divine intervention where Sham was resurrected, and the parents regained their sight through their son's virtue. The king, witnessing this miracle, vowed to rule righteously and the people were encouraged to practice good virtues. Buddha reveals the identities of those present in the audience who were reincarnations of the people in the past life.
