<h4>Summary</h4>
This text recounts the story of the Buddha's aunt and foster mother, Mahaprajapati Gotami, and her 500 female disciples, who all achieved enlightenment. Foreseeing the Buddha's impending death, they decided to pass away first. Mahaprajapati displayed miraculous powers before her death and the Buddha later praised her exceptional qualities, stating she had transformed from a woman of negative traits to a wise and enlightened being, even greater than he was able to repay for her gift of raising him. The Buddha instructed that a memorial be built in her honor, which prompted widespread grief and reflections on the impermanence of life, but ultimately led to increased faith.
