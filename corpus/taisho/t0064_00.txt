<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha was giving a sermon to a gathering of monks when he declared that there was an impure member among them. Mahāmaudgalyāyana used his psychic powers to identify the offending monk and expelled him from the assembly. The Buddha then explained that the presence of such impure individuals can corrupt the rest of the sangha and that monks should be vigilant in identifying and removing those who falsely claim to be practicing the Dharma, comparing them to weeds in a field or flawed timber.
