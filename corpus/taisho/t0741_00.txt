<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha explains the concept of five kinds of suffering in the cycle of birth and death across the three realms and five paths.
These include the suffering of heavenly beings, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, and those in hell. Even heavenly beings, despite
their long lives and pleasures, face eventual death and destruction, while humans endure countless hardships such as aging, sickness,
conflicts, and death. Animals suffer from fear, predation, and exploitation; hungry ghosts experience extreme hunger and thirst without
relief; and those in hell undergo severe punishments based on their past deeds. The Buddha emphasizes that liberation from these
sufferings requires discipline, wisdom, and detachment from worldly attachments, urging his disciples to transcend the cycle of
suffering through spiritual cultivation.
