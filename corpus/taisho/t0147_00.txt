<h4>Summary</h4>
At one time, the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, when King Prasenajit had a frightening dream consisting of ten strange omens. Disturbed, the king
summoned his ministers and ascetics to interpret them. One ascetic predicted the downfall of the king and his kingdom, advising extreme measures
such as killing the prince and burning treasures to appease the gods. The Buddha reassured him that these omens were not about his present rule but
foretold future societal changes, such as moral decline, social disorder, and corruption.
