<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha, while visiting a wealthy man's home, encounters a proud and disrespectful daughter-in-law named Yu-ye. He teaches her about the proper conduct for women, outlining the "three hindrances," "ten evils," five types of wives, and the virtues and vices in serving her family. Yu-ye, deeply moved and ashamed, repents her past behavior, takes refuge in the Buddha's teachings, and vows to follow his instructions. Ultimately, she gains enlightenment and dedicates herself to spreading the Dharma.
