<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha is residing at Jetavana Monastery when two Bodhisattvas arrive from a distant world to inquire about his well-being and the peace of the land. They bring with them a Dhāraṇī (a type of mantra) sent by their Buddha to protect beings from harm, grant peace, and ensure good fortune. The Buddha then teaches the Dhāraṇī to Ānanda, highlighting its rarity and the immense benefits it offers, including protection from various dangers and knowledge of past lives. He adds two more dhāraṇīs and explains how to recite them when faced with various dangers and challenges.
