<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha taught the monks about the nature of the world, where people often indulge in sensual pleasures, leading to the decline of good and the increase of evil. He described four types of actions: those that bring pleasure now but suffering later, those that bring suffering now but pleasure later, those that bring suffering now and later, and those that bring pleasure now and later. The wise discern these consequences and choose actions that lead to the decrease of evil and the increase of good, ultimately leading to enlightenment and Nirvana.
