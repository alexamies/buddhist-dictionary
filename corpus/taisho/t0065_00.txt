<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha, while in Jetavana, was asked by Anathapindika about the types of ways to subdue or control money. The Buddha describes ten ways people handle wealth, ranging from acquiring it through unlawful means and not using it for good, to acquiring it lawfully and using it for personal benefit, charitable giving, or both. The best way involves lawful acquisition, benefiting oneself and others, and detachment from the wealth with the understanding that it is transient. The Buddha emphasizes that the wise person acts with knowledge and contentment, using resources without greed.
