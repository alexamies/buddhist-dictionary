<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha teaches King Pasenadi about four types of people in the world, categorized by their initial and final states in life, focusing on their actions and attitudes towards others. These categories are: those who start poor and end well through good deeds, those who start rich and end poorly due to bad actions, those who start and end poorly, and those who start and end well. The Buddha emphasizes the importance of virtuous behavior, respect for others, and generosity, leading to a favorable rebirth, while condemning evil actions and wrong views which lead to suffering. The King is encouraged to emulate those who are good in the beginning and end, avoiding those who are bad in the beginning and end.
