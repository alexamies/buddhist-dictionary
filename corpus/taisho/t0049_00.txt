<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha explains to Śāriputra that people can be categorized based on whether they have desires and whether they are aware of those desires. Those who have desires but are unaware of them, or those who lack desires but are unaware of that lack, are considered the worst. Conversely, those who have desires and are aware of them, or those who lack desires and are aware of that lack, are considered the best. The discourse further elaborates on how desires can lead to negative actions and suffering, while their absence, coupled with awareness, promotes positive actions and well-being, using analogies such as dirty and clean bowls.
