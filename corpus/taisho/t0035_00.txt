<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha, during a gathering by a river, declines to recite the precepts due to the presence of impure individuals. He then describes the ocean's eight virtues, using them as analogies to illustrate the virtues of his teachings. These virtues include the ocean's vastness, its adherence to tides, its containment of treasures while rejecting impurities, its acceptance of all rivers while maintaining constant volume, and the uniformity of its saltiness. The Buddha concludes by stating that his teachings possess similar virtues and will not recite the heavy precepts anymore from then on.
