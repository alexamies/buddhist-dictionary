<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha describes observing people's deaths, some ascending to heaven and others descending into hell (Naraka) based on their actions, speech, and thoughts in life. Those who were unkind, disrespectful, and did evil deeds are judged by Yama, the king of hell, and questioned about their failings in life. Subsequently, they endure horrific tortures in various hells within an iron city, facing fire, sharp mountains, and flesh-eating insects, experiencing prolonged suffering. The text ends by saying those who do good works can avoid these hell realms.
