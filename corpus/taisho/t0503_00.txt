<h4>Summary</h4>
A monk living in a forest, falsely accused of inappropriate relations with a woman, contemplates suicide to escape the scandal. A forest deity, concerned by this act, appears disguised as a woman to test his resolve. When the monk insists on ending his life despite the deity's provocation, the deity reveals their true form and delivers a verse emphasizing the importance of enduring criticism and focusing on inner understanding rather than external opinions. Inspired by the deity's words, the monk meditates diligently, overcomes his afflictions, and attains enlightenment.
