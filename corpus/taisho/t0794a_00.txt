<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha, while in the Jetavana Grove in Rajagriha, instructed the monks on the proper times and improper times for certain activities, dividing the year into months and specifying auspicious and inauspicious periods within each month based on numerical calculations of "feet" and "fingers". He emphasized the importance of understanding these times for the benefit and liberation of all beings, encouraging the monks to practice diligently and avoid negligence. The monks rejoiced in this teaching, recognizing that good deeds lead to positive outcomes, while neglecting the proper conditions leads to suffering.
