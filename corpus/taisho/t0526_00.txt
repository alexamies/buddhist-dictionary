<h4>Summary</h4>
This text tells the story of a wealthy young man named Zhi (制), who encounters the Buddha while he is begging for food. Impressed by the Buddha's appearance, Zhi offers his own meal and clothes, expressing his desire to become a Buddha himself. Despite the doubts voiced by the god Śakra, Zhi insists on his aspiration with unwavering determination, vowing to endure any hardship to achieve enlightenment. Buddha then prophesizes that after countless eons, Zhi will become a Buddha named Sumerukara and will save countless beings.
