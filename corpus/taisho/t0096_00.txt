<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha teaches that practicing mindful breathing and following the correct path leads to enlightenment, just as the moon emerges
from behind the clouds. A monk who establishes mindfulness in standing, sitting, and lying down will benefit in the present and future,
avoiding distractions and doubts. By maintaining focus and not desiring existence or nonexistence, one can transcend birth and death,
attain inner peace, and overcome aging and illness. Diligence in meditation, discipline, and generosity leads to liberation from suffering,
with true disciples of the Buddha constantly cultivating mindfulness, wisdom, and virtuous conduct.
