<h4>Summary</h4>
This text describes eighteen hells (泥犁) and the varying degrees of suffering experienced within them based on one's actions in life. The first eight hells are fiery, while the latter ten are cold, with punishments including being burned, crushed, and frozen for unimaginable lengths of time. The length of stay and severity of suffering in each hell depends on the severity of one's evil deeds, but knowing and practicing the Buddha's teachings can lessen the suffering or even lead to rebirth in a higher realm. Ultimately, the text emphasizes the importance of virtuous behavior and understanding the Buddha's path to avoid these hellish realms and attain a better existence.
