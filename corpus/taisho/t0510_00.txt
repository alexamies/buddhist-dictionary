<h4>Summary</h4>
The story recounts how a group of flower gatherers, tasked with providing flowers for the king, encountered the Buddha and offered their flowers to him instead. Realizing they disobeyed the king's order and could face execution, they prepared for the worst. The king, angered by their disobedience and curious about their lack of fear, learned from the Buddha that their act of devotion led to a prediction (授決) of their future Buddhahood, named "妙華如來" (Wonderful Flower Tathagata), and that their baskets miraculously remained full of fragrant flowers as a result of their faith. The king, amazed and repentant, released them and sought forgiveness for his initial anger.
