<h4>Summary</h4>
In a kingdom, a wealthy but greedy man named Yuenan is reborn as a blind beggar after death as punishment for his lack of generosity. One day, while begging, he is severely beaten by his own son from his previous life, who is also greedy. Moved by the suffering, the Buddha arrives and restores the blind beggar's sight, revealing his past life and the consequences of his actions, and teaches that wealth is impermanent and should be used for good, and that not doing so leads to suffering.
