<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha, while at a large tree, explains to Ananda the relationship between one's actions and their resulting rewards or punishments in future lives. Virtuous deeds like generosity, upholding precepts, and practicing patience lead to positive outcomes such as wealth, longevity, and beauty, while negative actions like anger, stealing, and harming others result in suffering and undesirable rebirths. The Buddha emphasizes the importance of personal effort in accumulating merit and cautions against laziness, highlighting that good and bad deeds inevitably follow a person like a shadow. He concludes by stating that understanding this cycle of cause and effect leads to enlightenment and liberation from suffering.
