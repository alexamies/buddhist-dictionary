<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha was residing in Jetavana Monastery in Śrāvastī when King Candravatī, a devout Brahmin follower,
was deceived by jealous concubines and Brahmins into believing that his pregnant consort's child would bring
misfortune. Acting on this false prophecy, the king ordered her execution, but the child survived in the
grave, nourished by his mother’s miraculously preserved body. At six years old, the boy encountered the
Buddha, who ordained him as a monk named Sudatta.
