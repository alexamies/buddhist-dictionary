<h4>Summary</h4>
This text recounts a discourse by the Buddha about future times and the eventual arrival of the next Buddha, Maitreya. It describes a future era of prosperity and long lifespans, ruled by a righteous king who will eventually renounce his kingdom to become a monk. The Buddha also foretells the coming of Maitreya Buddha, whose teachings will be widely accepted, much like the Buddha's own. Finally, the story includes an interaction with Mara, a demon who attempts to disrupt the Buddha's teaching by painting a picture of a degenerate future but is ultimately refuted and shamed.
