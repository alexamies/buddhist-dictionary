<h4>Summary</h4>
The text describes Maudgalyayana (目連), a disciple of the Buddha, encountering various hungry ghosts (餓鬼) near a river and inquiring about the reasons for their suffering. Each ghost recounts their past misdeeds, such as mistreating others, being greedy, or harming living beings. Maudgalyayana explains that their current suffering is the karmic consequence of those actions, highlighting the principle of cause and effect. The consequences are described as "flower rewards" that lead to rebirth in hell.
