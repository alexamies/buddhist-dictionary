<h4>Summary</h4>
The text describes how the Buddha, while begging for alms, was seen by a sixteen-year-old boy named Shi (逝) who was immediately filled with reverence. Shi offered his food and clothing to the Buddha, expressing his desire to attain the same wisdom as the Buddha, rather than worldly riches. The god Indra initially tried to dissuade him, but Shi remained steadfast, impressing even Indra with his resolve. The Buddha then prophesied that after countless lifetimes of virtuous deeds, Shi would ultimately become a Buddha named Sumi Jie (須彌劫).
