<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha teaches that one should practice diligently, sitting alone in meditation and focusing the mind. True victory is not about
conquering others in battle but mastering oneself by overcoming negative thoughts and desires. A person who disciplines themselves
and follows the teachings can then guide others effectively, ensuring that both they and their followers find liberation from suffering.
The discussion also clarifies that skillful speech refers to teachings that do not confuse people, proper practice means adhering to
moral precepts, and true victory comes from self-restraint and wisdom.
