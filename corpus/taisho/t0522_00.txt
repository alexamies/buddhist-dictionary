<h4>English Translations</h4>
This text a king who deeply revered the Buddha and practiced humility, bowing even to monks, which confused and concerned his ministers.
To teach them a lesson about the value of human pride, he ordered human and animal heads to be sold in the market—animal heads were bought,
but the human head remained unwanted. Later, a monk revealed that the king was once a humble servant in a past life, and his present high
status came from faithfully practicing the Dharma. The monk, who was also a servant in that past life, had vowed to guide the king, and
now fulfilled that promise by bringing the Buddha, who inspired the entire kingdom to follow the Buddhist path.
