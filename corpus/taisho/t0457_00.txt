<h4>Summary</h4>
According to this sutra, when the future Buddha Maitreya arrives, the world will be transformed into a prosperous and virtuous land, where people live long lives, are generally free from suffering, and are motivated by good intentions. Maitreya will be born to Brahmin parents, possessing exceptional physical characteristics, and will achieve enlightenment under a Dragon Flower tree. He will then gather large assemblies of monks, nuns, and laypeople who will attain enlightenment by listening to his teachings based on the good deeds they performed during the time of Shakyamuni Buddha.
