<h4>Summary</h4>
A wealthy, childless couple prays for a son who is eventually born, but tragically dies after falling from a tree. Overcome with grief, they are visited by the Buddha who explains that their son's soul had previously resided in the Heaven of the Thirty-three and will be reborn as a dragon, only to be devoured by a golden-winged bird, thus experiencing sorrow in three places. The Buddha consoles the parents, explaining that their son's early death was the result of past actions of hunting and harming other living beings, while his wealth was a result of generosity in a past life, emphasizing the concept of karma.
