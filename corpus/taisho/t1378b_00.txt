<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha was in a bamboo grove when a monk was attacked by a snake, harassed by spirits, and robbed. A wizard named Bhadra offered to use spells, but the Buddha cautioned against harm. Bhadra then recited a spell to protect monks and disciples from various dangers, enemies, and malevolent spirits, promising safety and freedom from illness, ultimately urging reliance on the Buddha for liberation.
