<h4>Summary</h4>
This text recounts a profound teaching given by the Buddha at Jetavana Monastery, where countless beings — including bodhisattvas, monks, gods, and other
celestial and non-human beings — had gathered. The Buddha discussed the immense hardships bodhisattvas endure, including self-sacrifice and detachment
from all possessions, to help liberate all sentient beings. When some celestial beings became discouraged by the difficulty of the bodhisattva path and
considered pursuing the lesser paths of Arhatship or Pratyekabuddhahood, the Buddha manifested a miraculous event involving a sacred alms bowl.
Manjusri Bodhisattva, through extraordinary spiritual powers, retrieved the bowl from a distant Buddha land, demonstrating his deep wisdom and past-life
connection with the Buddha — revealing he was once the Buddha’s teacher and benefactor.
