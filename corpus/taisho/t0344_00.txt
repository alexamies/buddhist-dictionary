<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha was residing at Vulture Peak with thousands of monks, bodhisattvas, celestial beings, and other followers when the prince
arrived with 500 noble youths to pay respects. Vasumitra asked the Buddha about the causes of various extraordinary qualities of bodhisattvas,
such as beauty, miraculous birth, wisdom, and divine abilities. The Buddha explained that these qualities arise from past virtuous actions,
including patience, generosity, discipline, and compassion. Finally, the Buddha revealed that Vasumitra and his companions had cultivated
the bodhisattva path over many past lives and would eventually attain Buddhahood, bringing great joy to all present.
