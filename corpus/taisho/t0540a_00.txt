<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha recounts the story of a wealthy man named Shutijia, whose possessions far exceeded even the king's. Intrigued and envious, the king visited Shutijia's home with a large entourage, experiencing incredible luxury and splendor. The king, tempted to seize Shutijia's wealth, attempted to attack his home, but was thwarted by a powerful guardian. Ultimately, Shutijia and the king went to the Buddha, who revealed that Shutijia's great fortune was the result of past charitable deeds.
