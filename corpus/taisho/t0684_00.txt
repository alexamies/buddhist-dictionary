<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha teaches that children can never fully repay the great kindness of their parents who nurtured them. He explains that even carrying one's parents for a thousand years, even if they were to soil one's back, would be insufficient repayment. Rather, children can best repay their parents by guiding them to faith, morality, knowledge, generosity, and ultimately to believe in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, leading them to enlightenment and a higher spiritual path.
