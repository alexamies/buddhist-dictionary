<h4>Summary</h4>
At one time, the Buddha was in Jetavana, Śrāvastī, with many monks and bodhisattvas. He spoke to Mahākāśyapa about various faults
that could lead monks to suffering, such as attachment to possessions, seeking offerings, envy, and failing to uphold precepts.
The Buddha explained the difference between false monks, who merely appear pious but act out of greed and deceit, and true monks,
who practice genuine discipline, renounce desires, and seek enlightenment without pride. He emphasized that true discipline
transcends worldly attachments and self-centered thoughts, likening it to the purity of empty space.
