<h4>Summary</h4>
One day, the Buddha was residing in Jetavana Monastery in Śrāvastī when the king approached him with great reverence, inviting him and his monks to a
meal in the city’s main streets. The king wished for his people to witness the Buddha’s presence, understand his greatness, and be inspired to
follow his teachings. The Buddha praised the king’s devotion, emphasizing that a ruler should guide his people with wisdom and virtue.
During the event, the king and his subjects made offerings and expressed their deep respect, while the Buddha taught about self-love,
the consequences of good and evil deeds, and the importance of righteousness.
