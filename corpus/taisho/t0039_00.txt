<h4>Summary</h4>
The text tells the story of a powerful ruler who conquered the four corners of the world and eventually ascended to the heavens to rule alongside Indra. Driven by insatiable desire, he plotted to usurp Indra's throne, but his ambition led to his downfall and a painful return to the human realm. The Buddha uses this story to illustrate that worldly desires are never truly fulfilling and only lead to suffering. True satisfaction comes from attaining enlightenment and transcending these desires.
