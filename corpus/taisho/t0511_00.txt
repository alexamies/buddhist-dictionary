<h4>Summary</h4>
King Pingbisha of Wangshe City had five wishes fulfilled, including encountering the Buddha and understanding his teachings. A distant king, Fukasha, who had previously seen the Buddha, sent Pingbisha a thousand-petaled golden lotus as a gift, prompting Pingbisha to tell him about the Buddha. Fukasha renounced his kingdom upon reading Pingbisha's letter about the Buddha's teachings and traveled to meet him, encountering the Buddha in disguise at a potter's house where the Buddha then expounded the Dharma, leading Fukasha to enlightenment before his unfortunate death and subsequent rebirth in a higher realm.
