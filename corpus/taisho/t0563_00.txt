<h4>Summary</h4>
While the Buddha was preaching, a woman in the audience who was pregnant had a child in her womb who listened attentively with clasped hands. The Buddha revealed the child to the audience, who was subsequently born and sat on a lotus flower.  Seventy-five pregnant women inspired by the event wished to become men and Bodhisattvas, and their husbands also desired to become monks, resulting in miraculous transformations and widespread joy.
