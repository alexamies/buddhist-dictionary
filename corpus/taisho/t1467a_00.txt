<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha, residing in the Bamboo Grove at Rajagrha, answers a question from Maudgalyayana about the consequences of monks and nuns violating monastic rules due to a lack of shame and respect for the Buddha's teachings. The Buddha explains that different levels of transgression, such as violating minor or major precepts, result in vastly different periods of suffering in hell realms, equivalent to immense spans of human years. Maudgalyayana expresses joy and then recites a verse highlighting the relationship between actions and their consequences, emphasizing the importance of observing precepts to avoid suffering and attain liberation.
