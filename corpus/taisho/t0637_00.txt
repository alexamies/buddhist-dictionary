<h4>Summary</h4>
During a gathering at the Bamboo Garden in Rajagrha, the Buddha revealed the profound Samadhi of the Jewel Tathagata, causing miraculous transformations such as the land becoming even like a Buddha-land and women turning into men. Countless Bodhisattvas from various Buddha-lands arrived with offerings of flowers to pay homage and to ask the Buddha questions about enlightenment, the nature of reality, and the path to liberation. Throughout the discourse, the Buddha and other enlightened beings discuss core concepts like emptiness, non-duality, and the importance of developing certain qualities, such as non-attachment and compassion, to attain enlightenment and help others escape suffering. As a result of the teachings, many attendees, including celestial beings and humans, achieved insights into the Dharma and attained specific levels of enlightenment.
