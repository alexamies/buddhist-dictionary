<h4>Summary</h4>
Once, the Buddha was in Śrāvastī with his disciples when a man, his pregnant wife, and their two children traveled back to her homeland.
Along the way, a venomous snake killed the husband, and while crossing a river, wolves devoured one child, the other drowned, and she
lost her unborn child. Upon reaching her parents’ home, she learned they had perished in a fire, and her husband's family had been killed by
bandits. Overcome with grief and madness, she wandered naked until she reached the Buddha, who calmed her mind and clothed her. Hearing his
teachings on impermanence and suffering, she gained deep insight, overcame her sorrow, and attained an unwavering path to enlightenment.
