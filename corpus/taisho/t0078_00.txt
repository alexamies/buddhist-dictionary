<h4>Summary</h4>
One day, the Buddha was passing by the house of a man named Gu, whose pet dog, Luo, aggressively barked at him. The Buddha revealed that the dog
was actually Gu’s father, Du-Tiao, who had been reborn due to his past arrogance and harsh nature. To confirm this, Gu tested the dog, which led
him to uncover hidden treasures, proving the Buddha’s words. Realizing the truth, Gu sought the Buddha’s wisdom on why people have different fates,
and the Buddha explained that one's past deeds determine their future conditions, such as wealth, beauty, and lifespan.
