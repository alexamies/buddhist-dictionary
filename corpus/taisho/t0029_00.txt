<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha teaches a group of monks about seven types of people, using the metaphor of someone in water. These types range from those completely submerged and suffering to those who have reached the opposite shore and achieved enlightenment. The stages between represent varying degrees of progress in faith, good deeds, and ultimately, liberation from suffering. The Buddha encourages the monks to practice diligently and strive for enlightenment, emphasizing the importance of diligence and meditation.
