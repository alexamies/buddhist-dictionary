<h4>Summary</h4>
A wealthy man's son, previously married, becomes a monk after realizing the importance of meditation and contemplation. His former wife and mother-in-law confront him, lamenting his abandonment and the perceived loss of their daughter's attractiveness in society. The monk explains his renunciation through verses highlighting the negative qualities he observed, focusing on speech and internal thoughts. Ultimately, they understand his choice and leave, while the Buddha praises him as the foremost disciple in subduing temptation.
