<h4>Summary</h4>
Once, the Buddha was staying in Jetavana, in the kingdom of Śrāvastī, and taught the monks that the Dharma exists eternally,
whether or not a Buddha appears. The Buddha expounded on profound truths, explaining the Four Noble Truths and the nature of 
suffering, which arises from attachment and the cycle of rebirth. He described how one can transcend suffering by 
eliminating the roots of ignorance and desire, leading to the realization of emptiness and ultimately attaining Arhatship, 
Pratyekabuddhahood, or the Bodhisattva path. The ultimate goal is Buddhahood, which liberates all beings, and the Dharma 
acts as a great medicine to heal suffering, bringing enlightenment to all who follow it with sincerity.
