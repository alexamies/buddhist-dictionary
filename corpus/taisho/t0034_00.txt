<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha, while residing with a large group of monks, refrains from reciting the precepts on the usual day because he senses impurity within the assembly.  Maudgalyayana identifies a monk who has broken a serious precept and expels him, but the monk returns, prompting a second expulsion and further questioning by Maudgalyayana.  The Buddha then declares that he will no longer recite the precepts himself, due to the presence of those who silently transgress, instead tasking the monks to recite them amongst themselves and explains that the monastic order is like a great ocean, possessing eight virtues.
