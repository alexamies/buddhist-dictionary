<h4>Summary</h4>
Once, the Buddha was staying in Bamboo Grove with 1,250 monks. At that time, King Moda was preparing for war and had
conscripted millions of people. A certain monk, who had attained Arhatship, came to the kingdom for alms but was
instead forced to care for the royal horses for seven days. When the king later inspected his army, the monk
displayed his miraculous powers by flying into the sky, frightening the king, who then repented for his mistake.
