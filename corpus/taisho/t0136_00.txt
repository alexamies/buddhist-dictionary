<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha describes four unprecedented qualities possessed by a Wheel-Turning King: being loved by the people like a father, bringing joy to the people when seen, providing teachings that are endlessly appreciated, and giving instructions that the people eagerly follow. These four qualities are then mirrored in the Venerable Ananda, who brings joy and endless satisfaction with his teachings to monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. The sutra highlights Ananda's popular appeal and skill in delivering the Dharma to various audiences within the Buddhist community. The text is intended to praise Ananda by comparing his virtues to those of an ideal righteous ruler.
