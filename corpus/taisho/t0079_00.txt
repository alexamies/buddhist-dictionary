<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha visits the home of a man named Śuka, where he encounters Śuka's dog. After the Buddha tells the dog that he used to be a chanting Brahmin, Śuka becomes angry and confronts the Buddha. The Buddha reveals that the dog was Śuka's father in a past life and challenges Śuka to test the truth of his statement. Śuka finds hidden wealth as a result of the Buddha's challenge, gains faith, and asks about the reasons for inequalities among people, to which the Buddha explains how actions and intentions lead to different outcomes in life and rebirth.
