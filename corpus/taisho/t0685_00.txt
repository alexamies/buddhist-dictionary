<h4>Summary</h4>
The text describes a scene where Maudgalyayana, a disciple of the Buddha, uses his supernatural powers to discover his deceased mother suffering in the realm of hungry ghosts. Unable to help her alone, the Buddha instructs him to make offerings to the monastic community on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, a practice called the Ullambana, to liberate not only his mother but also ancestors from suffering. This act of offering and seeking blessings from the monastic community can bring benefits to both living and deceased parents and relatives, granting them happiness and freedom from hardship. The Buddha encourages all disciples to follow this practice as an act of filial piety and to remember their parents with gratitude.
