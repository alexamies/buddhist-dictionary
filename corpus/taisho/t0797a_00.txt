<h4>Summary</h4>
This text tells the story of an incredibly old and impoverished man who seeks to see the Buddha. After initial resistance, the Buddha allows him entry and reveals the man's past life as a wealthy prince who denied a humble monk (now the future Buddha Maitreya) basic necessities, leading to his current suffering. The Buddha emphasizes the karmic consequences of greed and the merit of saving lives, then grants the old man ordination and spiritual insight. Finally, the Buddha extols the virtues of reciting and practicing this sutra.
