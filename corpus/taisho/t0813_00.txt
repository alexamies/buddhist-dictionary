<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha is residing in Vulture Peak Mountain with many disciples when Sariputra reflects on the Buddha's greatness. He praises the virtues of those who are without hope or attachment, living in peace and understanding the illusory nature of reality. The Buddha affirms Sariputra's insights and encourages him to gather more people to receive the teachings on this path of non-hope, leading to a profound understanding of the Dharma and liberation from suffering. This path emphasizes detachment from desires, thoughts, and conventional notions of self and existence.
