<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha recounts observing beings' karmic destinies with divine vision, noting how good deeds lead to favorable rebirths, while evil actions result in suffering in hell. The Buddha describes how those who lacked filial piety, respect for teachers, and moral conduct during their lives are judged by King Yama, the ruler of the underworld. Yama presents five "angel messengers"—infancy, old age, sickness, death, and punishments—as reminders of life's realities that the deceased ignored while alive, emphasizing that their suffering is a consequence of their own actions and choices. The deceased are then punished accordingly for the bad deeds they had committed in life.
