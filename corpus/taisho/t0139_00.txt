<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha described four great hells to the monks, each named after an individual: Tishya, Gopaali, Devadatta, and Maskarin. Each of these figures, due to their negative actions such as causing discord, slandering the virtuous, attempting to harm the Buddha, and leading others astray, experiences immense suffering with flames engulfing them, unable to be extinguished even by vast amounts of water. The severity of their suffering is directly proportional to the gravity of their misdeeds, serving as a cautionary tale for the monks. Hearing this, the monks were delighted and committed to practicing diligently.
