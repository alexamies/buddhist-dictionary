<h4>Summary</h4>
The Sutra of the Sāla Kingdom describes a prosperous and pleasure-seeking kingdom called Sāla. Buddha, seeing their attachment to worldly desires, uses his divine powers and radiant light to visit the kingdom, causing miraculous events and drawing the attention of the king and his people. The king, confronted by the Buddha's wisdom, seeks a way to escape suffering, and the Buddha teaches him the importance of giving, controlling desires, following the Buddha's teachings, and respecting teachers of the Dharma. The King and his people are converted, embrace the Buddha's teachings, and the Buddha prophesizes the King's future enlightenment as the "Light of Wisdom" Buddha, leading the people of Sāla to future Buddhahood as well.
