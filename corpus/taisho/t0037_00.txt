<h4>Summary</h4>
The Buddha explains the causal origins of suffering and liberation, emphasizing that both arise from specific roots. Suffering stems from a chain reaction beginning with lack of faith and culminating in attachment and ignorance. Conversely, liberation arises from association with wise individuals, leading to faith, mindfulness, ethical conduct, and ultimately, enlightenment through the practice of the Seven Factors of Awakening.
