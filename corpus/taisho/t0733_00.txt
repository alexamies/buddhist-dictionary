<h4>Summary</h4>
Once, the Buddha was in Śrāvastī, at the Jeta Grove monastery. He told Ānanda that many people fail to understand the true and profound Buddhist path,
instead resorting to superficial and false words to slander the Dharma and trouble his disciples. However, true practitioners should remain patient and
pure, like water that cleanses all filth without itself becoming impure, or like wind and fire that remove impurities without losing their essence.
Those who sincerely listen to the Dharma, even for a short moment, will gain immeasurable blessings, while those who give and support the Dharma will
receive divine protection and prosperity.
